extends layout

block content
  
  <!--The view extends the layout.pug base template and overrides the block named 'content'. It displays the title we passed in from the controller (via the render() method) and iterates through the book_list variable using the each-in-else syntax. A list item is created for each book displaying the book title as a link to the book's detail page followed by the author name. If there are no books in the book_list then the else clause is executed, and displays the text 'There are no books.' Note: We use book.url to provide the link to the detail record for each book (we've implemented this route, but not the page yet). This is a virtual property of the Book model which uses the model instance's _id field to produce a unique URL path.-->
