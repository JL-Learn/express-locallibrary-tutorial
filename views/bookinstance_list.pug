extends layout

block content
  h1= title

  // This view is much the same as all the others. It extends the layout, replacing 
    the content block, displays the title passed in from the controller, and iterates 
    through all the book copies in bookinstance_list. For each copy we display its 
    status (color coded) and if the book is not available, its expected return date. 
    One new feature is introducedâ€”we can use dot notation after a tag to assign a class. 
    So span.text-success will be compiled to <span class="text-success"> (and might also 
    be written in Pug as span(class="text-success").

  ul
    each val in bookinstance_list
      li
        a(href=val.url) #{val.book.title} : #{val.imprint} -
        if val.status=='Available'
          span.text-success #{val.status}
        else if val.status=='Maintenance'
          span.text-danger #{val.status}
        else
          span.text-warning #{val.status}
        if val.status!='Available'
          span  (Due: #{val.due_back_formatted} )

    else
      li There are no book copies in this library.
